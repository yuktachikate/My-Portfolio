Portfolio

    I have created a Portfolio website, which has 4 webpages 
        Home
        Projects 
        Research Papers
        CV

    I have created a navbar which takes the user to all the 4 pages mentioned above
    Navbar used <a> to link all the webpages with each other
    
    Home: 
        Home is the main page of the application which tells about me

   Projects and Certifications: 
        In Projects and Certifications I have entered some of my skill sets to justify my projects. Also I have added a list of my projects and certifications in a gallery format. On hovering on any box, we get to see a text which takes us to the details of the project or certificate. 
    
   Research Papers:
        I have added a Research Papers table, which contains list of my published research Papers.
